#+TITLE: Notes



* Day 2


** Idea [0%]
- Game about snatching birthday gifts
- Gifts, birthday cakes and dangerous objects are hurtling towards the player
- The player must defend themselves against the dangerous objects, while snatching up as many gifts and cakes as possible

*** TODO Level 1 --- Main target for the jam [66%]
- [X] The player controls a shooter that can only move in the x-axis by dragging their finger across the screen.
  + [X] Make a shooter component
  + [X] Create a bullet entity
  + [X] Spawn bullets on shooting
  + [X] Detect hits against target
- [100%] Gifts are snatched, and gives some points each, when they reach the bottom of the screen
  + [X] add gift entity
  + [X] add cake entity
  + [X] add random spawning of target entities like gifts or cakes
  + [X] point system
  + [X] The birthday cakes act like gifts, but are rarer, and they give more points, in addition to adding a multiplier to the points gotten by future gifts
- [ ] Dangerous objects are bombs, if they reach the bottom of the screen, the game is over
- [X] The player must tap the screen to fire a shot
- [X] There is a cooldown between shots
- [X] The shots from the shooter takes out gifts, cakes and dangerous objects alike
- [ ] add sprites to the entities --- image path

*** TODO Level 2 --- Extra content, if time allows [0%]
- [ ] Two tools, adding a net to catch gifts with, and the player can drag it in both the x and y directions

- [ ]Â Knives are added as a dangerous object, they end the game if the player's tool collides with them

- [ ] colliding with a bomb also ends the game

- [ ] Maybe objects move more erratically, than just downwards
*** TODO Level 3 --- Power ups [0%]
- [ ] Power ups beyond the cakes
- [ ] Perhaps reducing cooldown on shooter,  or making the bullets act differently?

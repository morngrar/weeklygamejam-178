# GiftSnatcher - My first attempt at react native and expo

This is the result of a 48-hour solo game jam as part of a university course during the autumn of 2020.
Prior to making this I had *no* experience with either React, React Native or Expo, so it was a completeley new 
experience for me. Also, it was streamed on Twitch, which complicated things, since I hadn't done that either
before.

As a theme for the jam, I used [Weekly Game Jam](http://www.weeklygamejam.com/), which I announced beforehand.
The theme was published friday evening, and was "Birthday Gift". During the following 48h-window I learned how
to use Expo and React Native to scramble together something - after having spent most of friday evening
being stumped on the theme. The biggest challenge was to take the concept of a realtime game loop and get that
to work within react native. Luckily I found a library that gave me basic realtime functionality like this.

All game art is made by me, also within the same time window, so be warned - and don't blame me when your eyes 
bleed:

## How to run
I could supply build instructions here, but why not just let you scan a QR-code?

Go to the [expo project page](https://expo.io/@morngrar/projects/GiftSnatcher) and scan the QR-code with your 
android phone. **Note**: you'll have to have the expo app installed before hand, but there's a link for that on
the page as well.


## How to play
Drag the bucket back and forth to catch gifts as they come for points. Dodge the giant falling blades, and shoot 
the bombs with your gun when you have it out. How to get your gun out? tap the top half of your screen to switch
between tools. How to shoot the gun? Tap the gun. Good luck.
